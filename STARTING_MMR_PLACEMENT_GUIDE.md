## How to Use This Guide

### Step 1: Get Player's Bowling Average
- Use their most recent season average
- If new to league: estimate from their best games or casual bowling
- Example: 168 average → Look for 160-170 range

### Step 2: Find Their Tier
- Match their average to the range in the Quick Reference table
- That's their starting MMR

### Step 3: Fine-Tune (Optional)
Adjust ±50-100 MMR within their tier based on:
- **Trending up** → Use higher MMR in range
- **Trending down** → Use lower MMR in range
- **Returning after break** → Use lower MMR
- **Brand new to league** → Use lower MMR for safety

**Examples:**

*162 average (range 160-170, tier Gold 7800)*
- Solid, consistent form → 7800 (standard placement)
- Just returned to league → 7600 (Silver III, play conservatively)
- Playing really well → Could place at 8100 (Gold II lower), promote to Div 1

*195 average (range 190-200, tier Platinum II 8700)*
- Solid performer → 8700 (standard placement)
- Trending up → Could go to 9000 (Emerald)
- New to Div 1 → 8100 (Gold II, softer entry)
